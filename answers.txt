What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, basic reproductive rate)

100000 People  -  90% Percent Vaccinated  - Name: The Cooties Virus  - Mortality rate:  5%   0.16 - 10

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

6.4%. Vaccination helps

What percentage of the population died from the virus?

~.3%

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
